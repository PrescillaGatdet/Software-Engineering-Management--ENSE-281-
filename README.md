### In this repository, the group will be posting different stages of the project as following:

- Project Prerequisites & System Design
- Project Progress Scrum / Check-in
- Project Delivery & Closing

### Project description:
- The project is about designing and developing a web-based software application on a small to medium scale, throughout the semester.
- The team came up with an idea of making an application that brings in different small household gigs (as jobs), all under one roof.
- The gigs include, but are not limited to, windows cleaning, fence painting, snow blowing, leaves raking etc.

### The working / main idea of this platform is as following:
- The people needing a speicifc service will make a post with images, description and the price they are willing to pay, which will probably be less than what bigger comapnies were going to charge them with.
- The workers who can utilize their skills in getting a job done can accept that offer, if they find the price better than which was going to be their earning for that job while working for bigger companies.
- The game changer in this idea is to introduce a negotiation option for both parties, so they can agree on a common budget, and eliminate the need of waiting for or working under big players in the market.
- The workers will accept the gigs, and the users will be notified that these workers are willing to get the job done, and the user can decide whom he wants, based on the worker profile ratings and bargained price.
- The platform will be making sure that both sides meet their respective needs with trust and reliability, with a friendly budget, making it a win-win situation for both sides.

## Hope you'll enjoy going through the work and efforts put in by the team!
